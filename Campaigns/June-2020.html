					<div class="content__item-copy">
						<p class="content__item-copy-text">
						Although his death was not a result of police brutality, he still died from a tragic death at 
						the hands of two white extremeists in a hate crime. He was peacefully jogging around his neigborhood when a 
						neighbourhood resident, Gregory McMichael, told police he thought Mr Arbery looked like the suspect in a 
						series of local break-ins. Police have said there wasn't even any reports regarding the break-ins that he was 
						talking about. Then, Greogory McMichael and his son Travis, armed themselves with a pistol and shotgun and 
						started following Mr.Arbery in a pickup truck. Afterwards, the two men decided to attack and ultimately shoot Ahamud Arbery three times, making Arbery fall down on the street.
		
						<br> <br> Arbery was a former star high school football player, and his father said he often exercised in the area.
						His family has described him as a good, generous young man with a big heart. He would have turned 26 in May this year in 2020.

						<br> <br> You can see how racism and white supremacy is evil and ultimately damage so many lives. It took so long to finally arrest the murderers of Arbery and William Bryan, the man who filmed a video while Arbery was being murdered is arrested and charged for murder. Being "not racist" is never enough, you have to actively be AGAINST racism and make real physical and verbal actions to stop racism or injustice anywhere.

								<span style="color: #941313;">"I can't breathe."</span>
								<br> <br>The death that shook the entire world. Derek Chauvin, the ex-police officer, kneeled on George's neck for almost nine minutes along with the compliance of Ex-Officers Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane. It all started with an unconfirmed faulty bill, which can happen to ANYONE; however, since Floyd was a black man, police targeted him, and he paid the ultimate price. <br> <br> Check daily what the officers' charges are and keep signing petitions to get the proper justice that is needed (posted in the "What Can We Do?" category).
								<br> <br> Unfortunately, after years of the same brutality happening to thousands of other black men and women, it was only until George Floyd's death that a vast majority woke up to the piercing yells of police brutality and racism. 

								<p>George Floyd was a loving father who moved to Minneapolis to start a better life. He had jobs as a security guard, bouncer and actively volunteered in his communities. Floyd would always try to make people laugh; in the clubs he worked at and the streets. He would actively try to help the troubled kids in the projects, speaking to them in kind words and hearing about their struggles. George Floyd was a man who had so much life and laughter, and in 10 minutes or so, it was all taken away. That is why we say #BlackLivesMatter.</p>

							Another devastating death, yet it seems like the world is less vocal about what happened to her. <br> <br>On March 13th, 
							police were executing a search warrant to find two 
							men accused of selling drugs at a house more than 10 miles from 
							Taylor's apartment. Breonna Taylor had nothing to do with the 
							investigation whatsoever; however, when the police barged into 
							her home with her boyfriend Kenneth Walker and her in bed, 
							it ended with Taylor having eight gunshots to her body,
							 lying dead in the apartment hall. <br> <br>Breonna Taylor was an essential worker, working extremely hard as a first responder (EMT) at two area hospitals. She wanted to build a career in health care because she cared about people. She had beautiful plans of becoming a nurse, buying a house and starting a family. All of that was stripped from her in seconds. 
							 <br> <br> Breonna Taylor's killers are STILL not charged or convicted. They have not even lost their jobs. The Louisville Metro Police Department continued to be even more indifferent to Breonna's death by publishing a mostly blank incident report. It reports that Breonna had "no injuries" (despite being SHOT EIGHT TIMES) and omits critical information like her street number, apartment number etc. 
							 <br> <br> With the recent uprising of George Floyd, we must also stand and fight for Breonna Taylor. Check the "What Can We Do" category to send a pre-written email to people who can give the justice that Taylor deserves and sign the petitions in her name.

  5) TRULY BECOME AN ALLY
  <br> <br> The #BlackLivesMatter Movement has been trending for some time, and while that is amazing for more people to join the conversation and share, please do not make it about "looking woke". Black lives are still being hunted down and killed for no reason, and that doesn't stop after this trending phase. Constantly read and better yourself to be a more reliable ally. 
  <br> <br> Watch movies, documentaries and books written by Black directors/authors, to get a better idea about how it's really like living in an anti-black society.
  <br> <br> Movies like "When They Can't See Us" or the "The 13th" is a good place to start. However as said before, this is not "done and never do again" kind of action. Always try to look out and be on the side of justice and equality.
